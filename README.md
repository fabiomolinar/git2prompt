## Rust reminders

As I am starting my journey with Rust, here it goes a few reminders:

- To create a new project, run `cargo new <project-name>`.
- To build the project, run `cargo build`.
- To run the project in dev mode, run `cargo run`.
- To run the project in release mode, run `cargo run --release`.
- To check the code without building the final library, run `cargo check`.
- To run tests, run `cargo test`.
- To run Rust built-in linters, run `cargo clippy` (run with `--fix` to automatically fix the issues).
- To run the tests with a specific test file, run `cargo test <test-file>`.
- To run the tests with a specific test function, run `cargo test <test-function>`.
