## Rust reminders

As I am starting my journey with Rust, here it goes a few reminders:

- To create a new project, run `cargo new <project-name>`.
- To build the project, run `cargo build`.
- To run the project in dev mode, run `cargo run`.
- To run the project in release mode, run `cargo run --release`.
